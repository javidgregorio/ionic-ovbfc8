      The app was developed by three STEM students who are currently studying empowerment technology in La Salle Green Hills. The app was created using stackblits.com by inputing a series of codes to achieve an application that provides an Ideal Weight Calcultor. The usage interface is simple. Users will simply type in the info needed by the calculator and just with one click, the calculator will provide the necessary informations. Weight Watchers aim to utilize computer coding in beneficial factors like this one.

    This Ideal Weight Calculator uses four different formulas to solve for your ideal weight: Miller's Formula, Robinson's Formula, Devine's Formula, and Hamwi's Formula. Unfortunately, the calculator does not work for people below 5 feet.
